		          <mark>They shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago.
		                Due to the expansion of the Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion populations in West and North Africa became separated. As the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more 
		                open habitats, lions moved from West to Central Africa</mark>. Lions from North Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago.
                     <P>Extinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and Africa.</P>
			            Genetic evidence revealed numerous mutations in lion samples from East and southern africa,which indicates that this group has a longer evolutionary history than genetically less diverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa.
		             <p>A whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples showed that samples from West Africa shared alleles with samples from Southern Africa, and samples from Central Africa shared alleles with samples from Asia.
		                This phenomenon indicates that Central Africa was a melting pot of lion populations after they had become isolated, possibly migrating through corridors in the 
					 <span style="color:blue;">Nile Basin</span> during the early
